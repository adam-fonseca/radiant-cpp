# Radiant Tooling Library

The Radiant tooling library is a collection of tools for developing Radiant.
Development environment initialization, building, testing, code coverage, and
more are all handled through the tooling library. It is recommended to install
the library in the python environment. Then the command line interface can be
invoked directly.

```
python -m pip install -e ./tools/rad

rad --help
```

Alternatively, the library may be invoked directly without installing it.

```
python ./tools/rad --help
```
